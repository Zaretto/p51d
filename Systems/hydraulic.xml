             Flow chart of hydraulic system on page 264 of maintenance
             manual AN 01-60JE-2.

             2000 RPM should give 1100 - 1250 psi of system pressure.
             Accumulator pressure is 1000 - 1100 psi.

             Using hydraulic equipment reduces pressure in accumulator.
             Unloader valve cuts in and starts building system pressure
             at 800 - 850 psi.

             Unloading valve should stay unloaded for 5 minutes before
             systems starts building pressure again.

             Fluid flow is 3.5 gpm.

             Hydraulic pressure gage has lag of no more than 2 seconds.

             Temperature changes causes a difference of up to 100 psi
             of air in accumulator. Air pressure in accumulator is
             375 - 425 psi when engine pump is inoperative and system
             pressure is exhausted.

             When hydraulic equipment is being used, system pressure drops.
             When it gets to 800 - 850 psi, fluid will flow from the
             accumulator to the system. The system pressure remains at
             800 - 850 psi, but the accumulator pressure starts dropping.
             When the accumulator pressure reaches 800 - 850 psi too, the
             engine pump starts increasing pressure in the accumulator
             and system again.

             Reservoir has 1.209 gallons volume with 0.5^3 inch reserved
             for brakes.
