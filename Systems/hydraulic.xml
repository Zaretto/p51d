             Flow chart of hydraulic system on page 264 of maintenance
             manual AN 01-60JE-2.

             2000 RPM should give 1100 - 1250 psi of system pressure.
             Accumulator pressure is 1000 - 1100 psi.

             Pump limit is 1500 psi (continuous) or 1750 psi for 15 seconds.
             Maximum speed is 4300 RPM.

             Using hydraulic equipment reduces pressure in accumulator.
             Unloader valve cuts in and starts building system pressure
             at 800 - 850 psi.

             Unloading valve should stay unloaded for 5 minutes before
             systems starts building pressure again.

             Fluid flow is 3.5 gpm.

             Hydraulic pressure gage has lag of no more than 2 seconds.

             Temperature changes causes a difference of up to 100 psi
             of air in accumulator. Air pressure in accumulator is
             375 - 425 psi when engine pump is inoperative and system
             pressure is exhausted.

             When hydraulic equipment is being used, system pressure drops.
             When it gets to 800 - 850 psi, fluid will flow from the
             accumulator (E) to the system (D). The system pressure remains
             at 800 - 850 psi, but the accumulator pressure starts dropping.
             When the accumulator pressure reaches 800 - 850 psi too, the
             engine pump starts increasing pressure in the accumulator
             and system again.

             Fluid flows from C through the one-way check valve to D.
             At the same time the accumulator is charged. When the
             accumulator reaches 1000 - 1100 psi, the unloading valve
             unloads and fluid starts to flow from C to B (50 psi).

             Reservoir has 1.209 gallons volume with 0.5^3 inch reserved
             for brakes.
